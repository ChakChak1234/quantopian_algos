Quantopian’s Privacy Policy
Last revised: June 15, 2018.

Quantopian is both a platform and a community. It's a place to write and test trading algorithms. It's a place to meet other algorithm writers, to share algorithms, ideas, strategies, and trading experiences. Quantopian, Inc. ("Quantopian", "we" or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. We have prepared this Privacy Policy to describe to you our practices regarding the Personal Information (as defined below) we collect from users of our website, located at quantopian.com, ("Site") and related Services (as defined in the Terms of Use). If you simply browse the Site, you are referred to in this Privacy Policy as a "Visitor". If you have registered with the Site and receive Services, you are referred to in this Privacy Policy as a "Member". Capitalized terms not defined in this Privacy Policy have the meanings given in our Terms of Use located at https://www.quantopian.com/policies/terms.
1. User Consent
By submitting Personal Information through our Site or Services, you agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy and you expressly consent to the collection, use and disclosure of the Personal Information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
2. A Note to Users Outside of the United States.
If you are a non U.S. user of the Site or Services, by visiting the Site and/or providing us with information, you acknowledge and agree that your Personal Information may be processed for the purposes identified in the Privacy Policy. In addition, your Personal Information may be transferred to and processed and stored in the country in which it was collected and in other countries, including the United States, where laws regarding processing of Personal Information may be less stringent than the laws in your country. Your information may be available to government authorities under lawful orders and law applicable in such jurisdictions. By providing your information, you consent to such transfer.
3. Children
Our Services and Site are not directed to children and children are not eligible to use our Services. Protecting the privacy of children is very important to us. We do not collect or maintain Personal Information from people we actually know are under 13 years of age without verifiable parental consent. If we later learn that a user is under 13 years of age, we will take steps to remove that user's Personal Information from our databases and to prevent the user from utilizing the Site and the Services.
4. Types of Information We Collect.
So that we are clear about the terminology we are using, when we refer to "Personal Information" we mean information that allows someone to identify or contact you, including, for example, your name, address, telephone number, e-mail address, as well as any other non-public information about you that is associated with or linked to any of the foregoing information. When we refer to "Anonymous Information" we mean information that is not associated with or linked to your Personal Information. Anonymous Information does not enable identification of or contact with individual persons.
Information You Provide to Us. 
Visitors and Members
lf you provide us feedback or contact us via e-mail, we will collect your name and e-mail address, as well as any other content included in the e-mail, in order to send you a reply.
When you participate in one of our surveys, we may collect additional information.
We may also collect Personal Information on the Site or through the Services when we make clear that we are collecting it and you voluntarily provide it, for example when you submit an application for employment.
Members Only 
We may collect Personal Information from you, such as your first and last name, physical mailing address, phone, e-mail address, age, credit card number, ethnicity, gender, marital status, education level, interests, hobbies and password when you create an account on the Site ("Account").
ln order to receive certain Services, you may provide a credit card number or other payment card information. Quantopian uses Stripe, Inc. to process orders for such services that are made through the Site. Therefore, such information will also be governed by Stripe, Inc.'s privacy policy, which can be viewed at https://stripe.com/us/privacy.
ln order to provide our Services, you may also provide us with Content (as defined in the Terms of Use).
We retain information on your behalf and for compliance purposes, such information includes files and messages that you store using your Account and/or when you create a profile (your "Profile").
Information Collected via Technology.
To make our Site and Services more useful to you, our servers (which may be hosted by a third party service provider) collect information from you, including your browser type, operating system, Internet Protocol (IP) address (a number that is automatically assigned to your computer when you use the Internet, which may vary from session to session), and domain name.
We also use cookies and URL information to gather information regarding the date and time of your visit, the website URL you were visiting immediately before you came to our Site and the website URL you visit as you leave our Site and the information for which you searched and which you viewed. "Cookies" are small pieces of information that a website sends to your computer’s web browser while you are viewing a website. We may use both session Cookies (which expire once you close your web browser) and persistent Cookies (which stay on your computer until you delete them) to provide you with a more personal and interactive experience on our Site. Persistent Cookies can be removed by following Internet browser help file directions; please note that certain aspects of the Site or Services may not be available if the Persistent Cookies are removed.
We may use third party service providers to help us analyze certain online activities. For example, these service providers may help us analyze visitor activity on the Site. We may permit these service providers to use cookies and other technologies to perform these services for us.
If you are logged into the Site or Services, the information collected via technology as described in this Section may be associated with your Personal Information and will, accordingly, be treated as Personal Information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
We collect and store performance data generated by your algorithms when you use the platform to backtest, paper trade, and live trade.
We may generate additional performance data from your algorithms for the purposes of (a) verifying that software platform changes do not change or break your algorithm and/or (b) analyzing standardized performance results. </ol> </ol>
5. Our Relationship with Social Networking Sites
We have created and may offer you interfaces that allow you to connect with social networking websites such as Facebook ("SN Site") through our Site. We will work with the SN Site’s application protocol interface (better known as their developer API) in a way that allows you to authorize us to access your account on that SN Site on your behalf. In order to provide this authorization, you will not provide us with your user name or password to the SN Site, but you will need to log-in to that SN Site directly through our Site. Once authorized by you, the SN Site will provide us a token that allows the SN Site to recognize us when we ask, on your behalf, for access to your account information or to post information. You will be able to revoke our access to any SN Site at any time by amending the appropriate settings from within your account settings on the applicable SN Site, though such revocation may limit the Services we are able to provide you.

Last revised: December 17, 2019.

INTRODUCTION
Welcome to Quantopian. Quantopian is both a web-based platform and a community. As a platform, it’s a place to write and test trading algorithms. As a community, it’s a place to meet other algorithm writers and to share algorithms, tools, ideas, strategies, and trading experiences.

Your access and use of Quantopian, including your use and adaptation of algorithms and other content shared by other members of the Quantopian community are subject to the Terms of Use set forth below.
We encourage you to share your algorithms and other Content (as defined below) you own, and we encourage you to use, adapt, and learn from others’ shared algorithms and other Content. You may, however, as a Member, decide to keep private some or all of the Content that you upload to, or write on, Quantopian, including algorithms that you write and test on Quantopian.

Except to the extent that Quantopian seeks to enforce its rights under any of the terms of this Agreement, Quantopian does not have editorial control over any Shared Content or Third Party Content.

Any Shared Content, Third Party Content, including, without limitation, such Content in the nature of opinions, advice, statements, services, offers, data or other information, expressed or made available on the Site or through the Services are those of the respective authors or distributors thereof, and not Quantopian. Neither Quantopian nor any third-party provider or distributor of data on or through the Site or Services guarantees, endorses, or is otherwise responsible or liable for the accuracy, completeness, timeliness, reliability, availability, or usefulness of any Content accessible through the Site or Services. Quantopian may remove any Content, Shared Content, or Third Party Content suspected to be in violation of the terms of this Agreement.

Quantopian will use reasonable best efforts to safeguard and use your Content as described in this Agreement and Privacy Policy.
If you choose to post, display or otherwise make your Content available in the Common Areas, such Content is considered Shared Content. By so posting any of your Content in Common Areas of the Site and Services, you hereby grant to Quantopian, users of the Site or any other Quantopian platform, and other Members a worldwide, sublicensable, assignable, royalty-free, fully paid, perpetual, irrevocable right and license to make, have made, use, reproduce, modify, translate, distribute, transmit, create derivative works of, perform, display, import, and otherwise exploit, without the requirement to make any payment to you or the need to seek any third party permission, such Content in any form, media, or technology, whether now known or hereafter devised or developed, and to allow others to do the same, but at all times, in accordance with Quantopian’s Privacy Policy. You represent that: (i) you have the necessary rights to grant Quantopian and other Members the license to use your Shared Content as described in the preceding sentence of this paragraph and (ii) all Shared Content is true, accurate, current and complete. The license you grant to Quantopian, as described in this paragraph, continues even if you stop using the Site and Services.
By contrast, when you choose to keep your Content private, we will use reasonable best efforts to keep your Content private. All Content that you do not post, display, or otherwise make available in Common Areas or share with any other selected Member(s) is treated as "Private Content," unless expressly noted otherwise; this includes your account information, algorithms, datasets, and other Content that only you can access. Quantopian will not review, share, or otherwise make use of Private Content except as specifically provided in our Privacy Policy or this Agreement. With respect to this Agreement, Quantopian may access, reproduce, store, delete, review, share, or otherwise make use of Private Content in the following circumstances (including in source code or similar form):
If necessary in the course of providing technical support or other maintenance of the Site or Services; provided that, wherever possible, any access by Quantopian for technical support or maintenance purposes will be restricted to the very specific technical purpose relevant to such support or maintenance;
In order to comply with any applicable legal or regulatory requirements or order of any court order or governmental authority;
In the event that we consider, in our discretion, that such Content may present a security risk;
In the event that we consider, in our discretion, that such Content may constitute a violation of the Terms of Use, including an infringement or misappropriation of any third party right or other unauthorized use of Third Party Content; or 
In the event that we consider, in our discretion, that such Content may be relevant to Quantopian’s defense in any legal proceeding. 
Additionally, in accordance with Quantopian's efforts to support the creation of high-quality strategies in which to invest, we may review the results of your backtests and the performance and other "data exhaust" of your Content (such results, performance data, and other data exhaust, collectively, "Performance Data"). Such Performance Data includes, but is not restricted to, returns and risk measurements of any backtest executed with the Content. We may generate additional Performance Data or other information from your Content for the purposes of (a) verifying that software platform changes do not change or break your algorithm or (b) analyzing standardized performance results. You further agree that Quantopian may reproduce, store, and create derivative works from your Private Content or other Content necessary to evaluate your algorithm. Any testing, evaluation, reproduction or other use will be done with the spirit and intent of protecting your Content. We may also share anonymized and/or aggregated Performance Data with third parties. Any such external or third party sharing or usage of Performance Data will not be authorized in the extent that sharing or usage of Performance Data would reveal the details and workings of the underlying Content.
With regard to your Private Content, you grant Quantopian a worldwide, sublicensable, assignable, royalty-free, fully paid, perpetual, irrevocable license to use your Private Content as described in this Agreement, including as discussed in this section. Further, with respect to your Private Content, you represent that: (i) you have the necessary rights to grant Quantopian the license to use your Private Content as described in this Agreement; and (ii) the Private Content does not violate any of Quantopian’s Terms of Use. The limited license you grant to Quantopian regarding use of your Private Content continues even if you stop using the Site and Services.
To the extent you choose to post, display or otherwise make your Content available to any selected Member(s), but do not otherwise make such content available in Common Areas, such content is considered "Collaborative Content." You hereby grant Quantopian a worldwide, sublicensable, assignable, royalty-free, fully paid, perpetual, irrevocable license to use your Collaborative Content for all uses applicable to your Private Content as well as any other uses (such as reproduction, display, and transmission) necessary to facilitate sharing of your Collaborative Content with the Members with whom you choose to collaborate. Further, you represent that: (i) you have the necessary rights to grant Quantopian the license to use your Collaborative Content as described in this Agreement; and (ii) the Collaborative Content does not violate any of Quantopian’s Terms of Use. The limited license you grant to Quantopian regarding use of your Collaborative Content continues even if you stop using the Site and Services. 
Additionally, with regard to your Collaborative Content, you represent to Quantopian that: (i) you have the necessary rights to grant the other selected Member(s) with whom you choose to collaborate such access and use of your Collaborative Content as you may permit; and (ii) such access and use does not violate any of Quantopian’s Terms of Use. Other business or legal terms relevant to your collaboration, such as scope of use, licensing, ownership, or other relevant rights and obligations with respect to your Collaborative Content and derivatives, if any, are to be addressed between you and the Member(s) with whom you choose to collaborate, all subject Quantopian’s Terms of Use. 
You understand and acknowledge that (i) the software, code, proprietary methods and systems used to provide the Site or Services, (ii) the design, look and feel of our template reports, (iii) the graphical elements of our template reports, (iv) the Content (other than the Content submitted by you or on your behalf or Shared Content owned by you or other Members), and (v) any intellectual property therein (collectively, "Our Intellectual Property") may not be copied, modified, reproduced, republished, posted, or transmitted by you unless it is Shared Content; and no Content, including Shared Content owned by Quantopian, but excluding Content submitted by you or on your behalf may be sold, offered for sale, or redistributed by you in a commercial manner without our prior written permission and the prior written permission of our applicable licensors (if applicable).

We will not collect your username and password for any such SN Site, and we will instead store the unique authorization code (or a "token") provided to us by the SN Site to access it on your behalf. You can revoke our access to an SN Site at any time by amending the appropriate settings from within your account settings on that site and/or on our Site. You should note that an SN Site may change or amend its guidelines and our access to it at any time, and we cannot guarantee that our Services will always include a connection to such SN Site.

We do not warrant that your information will be secure.

17. Jurisdictional Issues.
Quantopian makes no representation or warranty that the Content and information on the Site and/or the Services are appropriate or available or appropriate for use in locations outside the United States. Those who choose to access the Site or use the Services from other locations do so on their own initiative and at their own risk, and are responsible for compliance with local laws, if and to the extent applicable. Quantopian reserves the right, at any time in its sole discretion, to limit the availability and accessibility of the Site and/or the Services to any person, geographic area, or jurisdiction it so desires, and to limit the quantities of any such Service or products that it provides.
18. Arbitration Agreement And Jury Trial Waiver, Class Action Waiver, And Forum Selection Clause.
All controversies, disputes, demands, counts, claims, or causes of action between you and Quantopian arising out of, under, or related to these Terms of Use or our privacy practices (including any action we take or authorize with respect to information about or provided by you) shall be settled exclusively through binding arbitration.
Arbitration shall be subject to the Federal Arbitration Act and not any state arbitration law. The arbitration shall be conducted before one commercial arbitrator with substantial experience in resolving commercial contract disputes from the American Arbitration Association ("AAA"). As modified by these Terms of Use, and unless agreed upon by the parties in writing, the arbitration will be governed by the AAA’s Commercial Arbitration Rules and, if the arbitrator deems them applicable, the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (collectively "Rules and Procedures").
You are thus GIVING UP YOUR RIGHT TO GO TO COURT to assert or defend your rights under this contract EXCEPT for matters that may be taken to small claims court. Your rights will be determined by a NEUTRAL ARBITRATOR and NOT a judge or jury. You are entitled to a FAIR HEARING, BUT the arbitration procedures are SIMPLER AND MORE LIMITED THAN RULES APPLICABLE IN COURT. Arbitrator decisions are as enforceable as any court order and are subject to VERY LIMITED REVIEW BY A COURT.
You and Quantopian must abide by the following rules: (i) for any claim that could otherwise be brought in small claims court, the arbitration shall be conducted solely based on written submissions and, if the arbitrator deems it appropriate, a telephonic hearing; (ii) if the claim exceeds what can be recovered in a small claims court, the arbitration shall be conducted solely based on written submissions or a telephonic hearing, unless the arbitrator deems a face-to-face hearing is appropriate, in which case one should be held at a location agreed to by you and Quantopian, and if the parties cannot agree on a location for the hearing, the arbitrator will determine a location for the proceedings which is reasonably convenient to both parties with due consideration of their ability to travel and other pertinent circumstances; (iii) the arbitrator’s ruling is binding and not merely advisory; (iv) ANY CLAIMS BROUGHT BY YOU OR QUANTOPIAN MUST BE BROUGHT IN THE PARTIES’ INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING; (v) THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE MORE THAN ONE PERSON’S CLAIMS, AND MAY NOT OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF A REPRESENTATIVE OR CLASS PROCEEDING; (vi) in the event that you are able to demonstrate that the costs of arbitration will be prohibitive as compared to costs of litigation, Quantopian will pay as much of your filing and hearing fees in connection with the arbitration as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the arbitration from being cost-prohibitive as compared to the cost of litigation; (vii) Quantopian also reserves the right in its sole and exclusive discretion to assume responsibility for all of the costs of the arbitration; (viii) the arbitrator shall honor claims of privilege and privacy recognized at law; (ix) a decision by the arbitrator (including any finding of fact and/or conclusion of law) against either you or Quantopian shall be confidential unless otherwise required to be disclosed by law or by any administrative body and may not be collaterally used against either of them in existing or subsequent litigation or arbitration involving any other person/Quantopian customer; and (x) each side pays its own attorneys’ fees and expenses unless there is a statutory provision that requires the prevailing party to be paid its fees and litigation expenses.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, either you or Quantopian may bring an individual action in small claims court. In addition, if you are a Member outside of the United States, the dispute resolution provision in our Privacy Statement (if any), and not this arbitration provision, shall apply to any disputes related to privacy. Further, claims of defamation, violation of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, and infringement or misappropriation of the other party’s patent, copyright, trademark, or trade secret shall not be subject to this arbitration provision. Such claims shall be exclusively brought (unless such courts do not have personal jurisdiction in the dispute) in the courts located in New York, New York. Additionally, notwithstanding this arbitration provision, either party may seek emergency equitable relief before such courts in order to maintain the status quo pending the arbitrator’s ruling, and hereby agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of such courts. A request for interim measures shall not be deemed a waiver of the right to arbitrate.
With the exception of subparts (iv) and (v) in the paragraph above (prohibiting arbitration on a class or collective basis), if any part of this arbitration provision is deemed to be invalid, unenforceable or illegal, or otherwise conflicts with the Rules and Procedures, then the balance of this arbitration provision shall remain in effect and shall be construed in accordance with its terms as if the invalid, unenforceable, illegal or conflicting provision were not contained herein. If, however, either subpart (c) or (d) is found to be invalid, unenforceable or illegal, then the entirety of this arbitration provision shall be null and void, and neither you nor Quantopian shall be entitled to arbitration. In the event this arbitration provision is held unenforceable by a court, or in the event AAA refuses to arbitrate the dispute, all controversies, disputes, demands, counts, claims, or causes of action between you and Quantopian shall be exclusively brought in the state or federal courts specified in subsection "(d)" above.
For more information on AAA, its Rules and Procedures, and how to file an arbitration claim, you may call AAA at 800-778-7879 or visit the AAA website at http://www.adr.org.
19. Termination.
This Agreement shall remain effective until terminated in accordance with its own terms and conditions. You agree that Quantopian, in its sole discretion, may terminate your password, account (in whole or in part), or use of the Site or Services, and remove and discard any Content within the Sites, at any time and for any reason. You agree that any actions taken under this Section may be effective without prior notice to you. YOU AGREE THAT WE WILL NOT BE LIABLE TO YOU OR ANY OTHER PARTY FOR ANY TERMINATION OF YOUR ACCESS TO THE SITE OR SERVICES OR DELETION OF YOUR ACCOUNT OR YOUR UPLOADED CONTENT. In the event of termination, however, those Sections in this Agreement which, by their nature, survive termination of the Agreement shall so survive. Specifically, and without limitation, the licenses you have granted to Quantopian and to third parties to use any Content, Shared, Collaborative, and/or Private, submitted by you or through your account, survives the termination of this Agreement. Your license, as described in this Agreement, to use any Content and/or Shared Content owned by Quantopian does not survive the termination of this Agreement.
20. General Information.
This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement and understanding between you and Quantopian and governs your use of the Site and the Services, superseding any prior agreements between you and Quantopian. This Agreement and the relationship between you and Quantopian shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York, without regard to its conflict of law provisions. The failure of Quantopian to exercise or enforce any right or provision of this Agreement shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. If any provision of this Agreement is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be unlawful, void or for any reason unenforceable, then that provision shall be deemed severed herefrom and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions. The section titles in this Agreement are for convenience purposes only and have no legal or contractual effect. This Agreement is not assignable, transferable or sub-licensable by you. However, we may assign this Agreement to any third party whom we choose without your consent and/or without notice to you. No waiver by Quantopian of any breach or default hereunder shall be deemed a waiver of any preceding or subsequent breach or default. You acknowledge that we have the right hereunder to seek an injunction, if necessary, to stop or prevent a breach of your obligations hereunder.
21. Electronic Communications.
You acknowledge and understand that (a) we can only give you the benefits of accessing the Site and using the Services by conducting business through the Internet, and therefore we need you to consent to our giving you Communications (defined below) electronically, and (b) this Section 21 informs you of your rights when receiving Communications from us electronically. For contractual purposes, you: (i) consent to receive communications from us in an electronic form and (ii) agree that all terms and conditions, agreements, notices, documents, disclosures, and other communications ("Communications") that we provide to you electronically satisfy any legal requirement that such Communications would satisfy if they were in writing. Your consent to receive Communications and do business electronically, and our agreement to do so, applies to all of your interactions and transactions with us. The foregoing does not affect your non-waivable rights. You may also receive a copy of this Agreement. You may withdraw your consent to receive Communications electronically by contacting us in the manner described below. If you withdraw your consent, from that time forward, you must stop using the Site and Services. The withdrawal of your consent will not affect the legal validity and enforceability of any obligations or any electronic Communications provided or business transacted between us prior to the time you withdraw your consent. Please keep us informed of any changes in your email or mailing address so that you continue to receive all Communications without interruption.
22. Modification to Services.
We reserve the right to modify or discontinue the Site and any or all of the Servicess, including the Content and Shared Content owned by Quantopian, with or without notice to you. We will not be liable to you or any third party should we exercise our right to modify or discontinue the Site and/or any or all of the Services. If you object to any such changes, your sole recourse will be to cease access to the Site and/or Services, as applicable. Continued access to the Site and/or Services, as applicable, following notice of any such changes will indicate your acknowledgment of such changess; agreement to amended license terms, as applicable; and satisfaction with the Site and/or Services, as applicable, as so modified.
23. Amendments and Modifications of this Agreement.
Quantopian may amend or modify this Agreement from time to time and at any time. If any such amendment or modification is material, we will post notice of it on the Site’s home page, community forum, and/or by email to Members. Your access of the Site and use of the Services following any such amendment or modification shall be deemed your acceptance of such amendment and modification. You agree to review the Agreement periodically to be aware of such amendments and modifications.
